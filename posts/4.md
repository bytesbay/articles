Alright, let's not beat around the bush here. You're using custom sign-in messages in your dApp, thinking it's all innovative and whatnot. Well, I'm here to tell you that you're doing it wrong. Dead wrong. Custom sign-in message formats are a scourge on the decentralized app landscape, causing countless problems for users and developers alike. Time for a change, don't you think?

## The Problems: Causing Havoc for Wallets and Users

1. Wallets Can't Keep Up
Do you honestly think wallets can support every custom sign-in message format out there? Well, newsflash: they can't. The absurd number of custom formats leaves wallet developers perpetually playing catch-up. Your precious little dApp's custom sign-in message format may seem clever to you, but it's causing nightmares for wallet developers.

2. Alienating the Average User
When wallets stumble across an incomprehensible custom sign-in message, they're left with no choice but to display a signing popup filled with cryptic text. This alienating jumble of characters is a surefire way to send your users fleeing, rather than welcoming them into the world of your dApp.

## The Solution: Embrace "web3-token" and EIP-4361

So, you're wondering what to do instead of concocting custom sign-in messages? Say hello to "web3-token". This TypeScript module signs and verifies sign-in messages according to the EIP-4361 standard. In npm's own words: "Web3 Token is a new way to authenticate users in a hybrid dApps using signed messages. Implementation of EIP-4361."

```javascript
// Assuming 'web3-token' and 'ethers' npm packages are installed

import { sign, verify } from 'web3-token';
import * as Ethers from 'ethers';

const provider = new Ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
const signer = provider.getSigner();

const opts = {
  statement: 'I agree to the terms of service',
  domain: 'example.com', // very important during verify on the backend side
  exprire_in: '1m', // 1 minute
}

await sign(message => signer.signMessage(message), opts)
  .then(token => {
    // send token to the backend
  })
  .catch(err => {
    // handle error
  });

// later on the backend side

try {
  const { address } = verify(token, {
    domain: 'example.com',
  })

  console.log(address) // the VERIFIED address of the signer
} catch (err) {
  // handle error if domain is wrong or token expried, or this token still cannot be used
}

```

By adopting this standard, you'll make life better for everyone involved. Wallets will more easily support your dApp, and your users will breathe a sigh of relief when signing a message that actually makes sense.

## EIP-4361: Now Supported by MetaMask and Packed with Security Features

Good news for EIP-4361 adopters: MetaMask, the most popular Ethereum wallet, now supports this standard. What does that mean? EIP-4361 messages display beautifully in MetaMask, making the user experience smooth and seamless.

{~~ else ~~}

{~~ endif ~~}

Aside from its ease of use, EIP-4361 is also highly secure. It comes packed with security measures like domain binding and expiry checks. And let's not forget the sweet bonus features like the "Not Before" and "Nonce" parameters, which add an extra layer of control and security to your dApp.

Curious about how EIP-4361 works in action? Check out this [demo](https://web3token.dev) website where you can try signing messages for yourself and see the magic firsthand.

## Conclusion: Unleash the Power of Standards

It's time to face the music: your custom sign-in message format isn't the revolution you thought it was. It's just another contribution to the chaotic hellscape of dApps. Do us all a solid and adopt the EIP-4361 standard with web3-token. Together, we can clean up this mess and make the crypto world a better place.

Now, go forth and make smarter choices as you develop your dApps. Remember, power and responsibility go hand in hand â€“ and that includes ditching custom sign-in message formats.
