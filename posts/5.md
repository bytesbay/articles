## Introduction

AI is a hot topic these days, and everyone seems to be jumping on the bandwagon. But let's face it, AI is still in its infancy and has a long way to go before it can match human intelligence. Nevertheless, it has already shown its potential to transform various industries and change the way we interact with technology. In this article, we will explore how we can leverage the power of OpenAI API and ChatGPT to train an AI community manager.

## OpenAI API

The OpenAI API has democratized access to AI technology by providing access to pre-trained models like GPT-3. With the OpenAI API, developers can fine-tune these models for their specific use case and integrate them into their applications with relative ease. This has made it possible for small startups and individual developers to leverage the power of AI to build innovative products and services.

## Custom models in OpenAI (Fine-tuning)

While GPT-3 is a general solution for text tasks, it's not perfect for every task. That's where custom models come in. OpenAI has released a new API that allows you to fine-tune GPT-3 for your specific task. Fine-tuning GPT-3 requires a dataset in JSONL format, which is a simple format for storing data.

For example, suppose we want to train a custom model for a chatbot that can understand a user's mood. We can create a dataset in JSONL format like this:

```json
{"prompt": "User: Hello, how are you?\nBot:", "completion": " mood=good\n"}
{"prompt": "User: I'm feeling sad\nBot:", "completion": " mood=bad\n"}
{"prompt": "User: I'm feeling happy\nBot:", "completion": " mood=good\n"}
{"prompt": "User: I'm feeling angry\nBot:", "completion": " mood=bad\n"}
```

It's a good practice to add whitespace at the beginning of the completion, as recommended in OpenAI docs.

## Generating a dataset for an Artificial Community Manager using ChatGPT

Our task is to structure user messages in a parsable format. We need to understand whether the user is asking a question or not and what is the question type (e.g., `release_date`, `roadmap`, `token_address`, etc.). We can use ChatGPT to generate a dataset for custom OpenAI models.

We can give ChatGPT an example of a dataset and ask it to generate a new one. We can also give detailed requests to let ChatGPT understand what we need. For example, we can show ChatGPT this example request:

![ChatGPT request](/resources/5-2.jpg)

Here is ChatGPT's response:

![ChatGPT response](/resources/5-3.jpg)

After every ChatGPT response, we can ask it to generate a new one just with one word "More" and it will generate more variants. We can save the generated dataset to `train.jsonl`.

Okay, now lets save generated dataset to `train.jsonl`:

## Training a model with a Python CLI

To train a model, we need to use Python with OpenAI CLI. We can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade openai
# for mac users
# sudo -H pip3 install openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"
```

Now we can train a model using the dataset we just uploaded. We are not going to use the `davinci` model because it's an overkill for our task. We will use a simpler `curie` model, which is enough for structuring tasks:

```bash
openai api fine_tunes.create -t ./train.jsonl -m curie
```

We have to wait until the model is trained, which can take from 5 minutes to a couple of hours, depending on our luck (from my observations). After the model successfully trained, we will see something like this:

```bash
[2023-03-03 17:21:12] Created fine-tune: ft-MuO9i1TAnKHkNLOoUNmmfSrc
[2023-03-03 17:29:23] Fine-tune costs $0.00
[2023-03-03 17:29:24] Fine-tune enqueued. Queue number: 0
[2023-03-03 17:29:25] Fine-tune started
[2023-03-03 17:30:27] Completed epoch 1/4
[2023-03-03 17:30:29] Completed epoch 2/4
[2023-03-03 17:30:31] Completed epoch 3/4
[2023-03-03 17:30:33] Completed epoch 4/4
[2023-03-03 17:30:56] Uploaded model: curie:ft-miro-2023-03-03-15-30-56
[2023-03-03 17:30:57] Uploaded result file: file-4mtjZQX9QavHpVQwZHZ2M3fc
[2023-03-03 17:30:57] Fine-tune succeeded

Job complete! Status: succeeded ðŸŽ‰
```

## Testing the model

Now let's enter the OpenAI Playground to test our model. In the playground sidebar, select the model we just trained (e.g., `curie:ft-miro-2023-03-03-15-30-56`). Finally, let's enter some prompt in the textarea and press the Submit button:

Voila! The completion is right as we expected.

## Conclusion

With a little bit of creativity, ChatGPT can be used to come closer to a full AI singularity. By training an AI community manager, we can automate some of the more mundane tasks associated with managing a community, such as answering frequently asked questions. However, it's important to be mindful of the potential limitations and ethical concerns when using AI to manage a community. Nevertheless, the potential benefits are huge, and the future of AI is exciting. So, let's continue exploring the possibilities of AI and see where it takes us.
